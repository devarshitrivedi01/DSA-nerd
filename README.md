# Data-Structure-and-Algorithms
Data Structure is a way to Organize Data in computer's main memory, So that can be used efficiently. This is one of the Fundamental Concept's of Computer Science.

Some Data Structures are
* Array
* LinkedList
* Stack
* Queues
* Trees
* Graphs
* Hashing
etc...

There are also sorting and searching techniques in Data Structure. We also need to analyze the time and space use by perticular Data Structure. So, we can procced in efficient way.

This repository contain code of some programs of Data Structure and some Fundamental Concepts.

Thanks for Visiting!

I am currently doing work on it. So, in some days I will complete this repository.

## Fundamental Concepts
### 1. Recursion
