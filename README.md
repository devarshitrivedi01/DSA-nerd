# :books: Data-Structure-and-Algorithms
Data Structure is a way to Organize Data in computer's main memory, So that can be used efficiently. This is one of the Fundamental Concept's of Computer Science.

Some Data Structures are
* Array
* LinkedList
* Stack
* Queues
* Trees
* Graphs
* Hashing
etc...

There are also sorting and searching techniques in Data Structure. We also need to analyze the time and space use by perticular Data Structure. So, we can procced in efficient way.

This repository contain code of some programs of Data Structure and some Fundamental Concepts.

Thanks for Visiting!

I am currently doing work on it. So, in some days I will complete this repository.

  ### 1. Arrays ADT
  * [Array Master](https://github.com/devarshitrivedi01/DSA-nerd/blob/main/Array%20ADT/Array%20Master)
  
  :blue_book: What it is Include?
  
  First of all Array is created by pointer in Dynamic Memory and it is include Functions like 
  * Display Array
  * Insert an Element at Any Index
  * Add Element at Last
  * Delete an Element at Any Index
  * Linear Search
  * Binary Search
  * Display an Element of Any Index
  * Change an Element of Any Index
  * Maximum Element of Array
  * Minimum Element of Array
  * Sum of Element of Array
  * Average of Array
  * Reverse an Array
  * Swap two Element of Any Index
  * Insert an Element in Soarted Array (Index automatically organized)
  * Check Array is Soarted or Not
  * Make Negative and Positive Element Wall in Array
  * Sort an Array
